## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **Owner scoping is now on by default** (`zodResource` / `zodSubResource`).
  Any resource with an owner column (`f.owner()` or `owner: '<field>'`) gets
  an `OwnerScopeHook` on the read path in addition to the existing
  `OwnerStampHook` on the write path — list/read/update/delete only see the
  actor's own rows. **Breaking:** consumers relying on unscoped reads must
  opt out per resource with `ownerScope: false` (see
  `examples/sample-server/src/resources/pet/pet.resource.ts`, which opts out
  in favour of a custom owner-or-shared hook).
- **Response DTO exposure is opt-in.** A field reaches the response DTO only
  when it opts in (`dto: { response: true }` — every `f.*` helper sets this
  by default) or is a base-entity column (pk / createdAt / updatedAt /
  deletedAt). Raw zod fields without metadata stay off the wire, so
  forgetting to annotate fails closed. The credential-name heuristic
  (`/password|secret|token|mfa|otp|hash/i`) was **removed**: it hid harmless
  fields (`tokenExpiresAt`, `mfaEnabled`, `hashtags`) while missing real
  secrets (`apiKey`, `salt`, `cardNumber`). Keep secrets out with an
  explicit `dto: { response: false }`.
- **`defineZodUserMetadata` now projects through `projectSchema`** — the
  same projection path `zodResource` uses. Previously it compiled the whole
  schema into the response DTO, so `dto: { response: false }` was silently
  ignored for userMetadata columns.
- **Computed fields respect `dto: { response: false }`.** `f.compute`
  schemas built from entity schemas no longer re-expose columns the owning
  resource hides.
- **Path-scope invariants assert on real artifacts.** Sub-resource
  materialisation now verifies `PathScopeGuard` / `PathScopeHook` survived
  provider merging in `core.providers`; the write-only `meta.guards` mirror
  (and the tests that asserted on it) was removed in favour of behavioural
  e2e coverage (cross-owner nested access returns 404).

### Fixed

- `RocketsCoreExceptionsFilter` logs through Nest's `Logger` instead of
  `console.error`, on every 5xx — whether traces are printed is the
  consuming app's log-level decision, no longer gated on `NODE_ENV`
  (which is unset in many production containers). Validation errors are
  flattened by a local, typed implementation instead of reaching into
  Nest's private `ValidationPipe['flattenValidationErrors']`.
- `defineSubResource` distinguishes an entity class from a thunk via the
  `prototype` property descriptor (spec-mandated non-writable for ES6
  classes) instead of guessing from its presence; the genuinely ambiguous
  `function () {}` form now throws with guidance instead of silently
  resolving to the wrong interpretation.
- Firestore adapter round-trips `Date` values as native Firestore
  `Timestamp`s. Previously dates were stringified on write and guessed
  back from field names on read (`startsWith('date') || endsWith('At')`),
  so `dateCreated` came back a `Date` while `birthday` came back a string.
  **Data note:** rows written by earlier versions store ISO strings and are
  no longer converted on read.
- `InMemoryFirestoreBackend` keeps its store per instance; previously all
  instances in a process shared one module-level `Map`.
- Hook subclass caches (`OwnerScopeHook`, `OwnerStampHook`,
  `PathScopeHook`, `AfterCreateReloadHook`) use `WeakMap` keyed by entity
  class, matching `schema-registry` / `paginated-dto.factory`, so cached
  subclasses no longer pin entity classes for the process lifetime.
- `sample-server-auth` entities updated to the
  `@concepta/nestjs-* 8.0.0-alpha.8` contracts (`IdentityInterface.user`,
  required `passwordHash` / `type` / `description` columns).

### Testing

- Package e2e suites run one Jest process per spec file
  (`scripts/run-isolated-e2e.cjs`). Sharing one worker failed ~25% of full
  runs with rotating victims — cumulative process state across ~30 Nest +
  TypeORM app boots; every suite is green in isolation. `forceExit` and the
  barrel-last sequencer were removed (no barrel specs exist; runs exit
  cleanly on their own).
- The e2e-only monkey-patch of `@nestjs/core`'s `DependenciesScanner` and
  `CrudModule.forFeature` was deleted — the upstream sparse-exports bug it
  compensated for is fixed in `@concepta/nestjs-crud 8.0.0-alpha.8`. Suites
  now run against the real framework.
- A named e2e test pins the upstream error-message contract
  (`'No entity defined'`) that `SafeCrudContextInterceptor` string-matches
  on, so an upstream rewording fails loudly instead of turning non-CRUD
  routes into 500s.

### Known limitations

- Depends on pre-release `@concepta/nestjs-* 8.0.0-alpha.x`; upstream
  interface changes between alphas can break consumers (this release
  absorbs one such change).
- `SafeCrudContextInterceptor` still matches on the upstream exception
  message; it is deleted once the upstream fix (concepta/nestjs-crud
  `5249672f`) ships in a published alpha.
- `relation.shape` projections are filtered by the response opt-in rule
  while `f.compute` schemas are only filtered for explicit
  `response: false`; unifying the two is deliberate follow-up work.
- `scripts/run-isolated-e2e.cjs` and the two Babel plugins that adapt the
  ESM-only `@nestjs` v12 dist to Jest's CJS runtime are bridges: the
  planned Vitest migration (native ESM, `pool: 'forks'` isolation) removes
  all of them.
