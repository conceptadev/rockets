# Contributing to Rockets

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. This document covers what you
need to get a change merged.

## Before you start

- **Bug or feature?** Open an issue first using one of the
  [templates](https://github.com/conceptadev/rockets/issues/new/choose). For a
  design question or an idea that is not yet a proposal, use
  [Discussions](https://github.com/conceptadev/rockets/discussions).
- **Security issue?** Do **not** open a public issue — see
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development setup

Node 22 and Yarn 4 (via Corepack):

```bash
corepack enable
corepack yarn install
corepack yarn build
```

## The checks your PR must pass

Run these locally before pushing; CI runs the same set:

```bash
yarn build            # TypeScript project references
yarn typecheck:spec   # type-checks test files (the runner only transpiles)
yarn lint:all         # eslint + markdownlint
yarn test             # unit tests
yarn test:e2e         # package e2e tests
```

Example apps have their own e2e suites:

```bash
corepack yarn workspace sample-server test:e2e
corepack yarn workspace sample-server-auth test:e2e
corepack yarn workspace api test:e2e            # sample-code-review
```

If the full e2e run fails intermittently on a machine under memory
pressure, that is a known host-level effect, not a code defect — see the
"Intermittent e2e failures" entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Lower
the worker count (`--maxWorkers=2`) rather than retrying.

## Code standards

These are enforced in review, and most are enforced by lint:

- **No `any`.** Use `unknown` and narrow it, or define an interface.
- **No casts as workarounds** — no `as Type` to silence a real type
  error, no `@ts-ignore`, no `eslint-disable` to pass a gate.
- **Prefer deleting code over adding it.** Dead code, unused options and
  stale comments are defects.
- **Comment WHY, not WHAT.** A comment earns its place when the reason
  is non-obvious.
- **Match the surrounding module.** Naming, structure and idiom should
  be indistinguishable from neighbouring code.

## Tests

Integration/e2e is the default tier: new tests are `*.e2e-spec.ts`
booting a real Nest app with `supertest` and SQLite, unless a unit test
is specifically justified. Assert behaviour over HTTP, not internal
metadata that the code under test sets itself.

Test files are type-checked (`yarn typecheck:spec`) — they are held to
the same standards as source.

## Commits and pull requests

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, with `!` or a
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for breaking changes.
- Explain **why** in the body, not just what. If you rejected an
  alternative approach, say so.
- Keep the PR scoped. Unrelated refactors belong in their own PR.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased` for anything a consumer would
  notice, and document breaking changes with the migration step.

## Project layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `packages/rockets-core` | Planner and wiring layer; auth contract, resource planner, hooks |
| `packages/rockets-server` | External-auth server (`/me`, global guard) |
| `packages/rockets-server-auth` | Full built-in auth system (signup, login, OTP, admin) |
| `packages/rockets-repository-*` | Persistence adapters (TypeORM, Firestore) |
| `packages/rockets-adapter-firebase` | Firebase auth adapter |
| `examples/*` | Runnable sample apps, exercised by e2e |

## Releasing

All release commands are thin wrappers over Yarn 4's native versioning and
publishing. The tracked `.yarn/versions/alpha.yml` file is the retained decision
to release the six public packages as `1.0.0`; Yarn keeps that decision while
applying numbered prereleases.

**1. Bump versions** (every publishable workspace, in one command):

| Command | Example result | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `yarn version:alpha` | `1.0.0-alpha.8` → `1.0.0-alpha.9` | Advance the retained 1.0 alpha line. |
| `yarn version:stable` | `1.0.0-alpha.8` → `1.0.0` | Finalize 1.0 and consume the retained alpha plan. |
| `yarn version:patch` | `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` | Stable releases only, after `version:stable`. |
| `yarn version:minor` | `1.0.0` → `1.1.0` | Stable releases only, after `version:stable`. |
| `yarn version:major` | `1.0.0` → `2.0.0` | Stable releases only, after `version:stable`. |

Commit the manifest changes together with the retained plan. Do not run the
patch/minor/major helpers while `.yarn/versions/alpha.yml` is active; finalize
it with `version:stable` first. Changing from alpha to another prerelease label
is a reviewed release-workflow change, not an ad-hoc `version prerelease` bump.

**2. Verify before publishing:**

```bash
yarn release:check   # build + packed consumer + types + lint + tests + samples
yarn release:audit   # fails on high-severity advisories
yarn release:dry     # lists exactly what each tarball will contain
```

Read the `release:dry` output: each tarball must carry `dist/`,
`README.md`, `LICENSE.txt` and `CHANGELOG.md`, and must NOT carry `src/`,
`*.spec.*` or `docs/`. Cross-package dependencies are published as real
version ranges — Yarn resolves the `workspace:^` protocol at pack time
(verified for this source line: a packed `package.json` contains
`^1.0.0-alpha.8`, never
`workspace:`).

**3. Publish** to the matching dist-tag:

```bash
yarn publish:alpha    # or publish:beta / publish:latest
```

Each publish helper checks the aligned manifest version immediately before the
registry write. Alpha and beta versions must match their prerelease dist-tag;
`publish:latest` accepts only stable versions with no retained version plan.

Each of these re-runs `release:check`, does a clean build, then publishes
in topological order so dependencies go out before dependents. Use
`publish:latest` only for a stable release — it is the tag `npm install`
resolves by default.

**4. Confirm:**

```bash
npm view @concepta/rockets
npm dist-tag ls @concepta/rockets
```

## Naming

The npm scope is `@concepta` — the same scope as the upstream
`@concepta/nestjs-*` packages this project composes. Rockets packages are
distinguished by their name (`@concepta/rockets-core`,
`@concepta/rockets-auth`, …), not by a separate scope.

The GitHub organization is `conceptadev`, so package metadata
(`repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`) points at
`github.com/conceptadev/rockets`.
