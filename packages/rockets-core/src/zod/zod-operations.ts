 * OpenAPI components). Omit either one to keep the projection derived
 * from the resource schema.
 *
 * An override replaces the projection outright — it is not merged with
 * it. A field the resource schema hides via `dto: { response: false }`
 * is exposed again if the override schema declares it; that is the same
 * explicit opt-in the class path has when an app passes its own DTO.

   *
   * A plain `z.object` drops undeclared keys during parse, so a client
   * sending `{ "modelId": "x", "unexpected": 1 }` gets `201` and the
   * extra key vanishes — the client believes a strict API accepted it.
   * With `strictInput: true` the effective input schema (the derived
   * projection, or the `input` override) is compiled with `.strict()`,
   * unknown keys become validation issues, and the response is `400`
   * naming the offending keys in the message.
   *
   * Know exactly what you are buying:
   *
   * - **Top-level only.** zod's `.strict()` does not recurse: an
   *   unknown key inside a nested object is still stripped silently.
   * - **Declared-but-projected fields are REJECTED, not ignored.**
   *   `id`, `dateCreated`/`dateUpdated`, `version`, owner columns and
   *   `dto: { create: false }` fields are not in the input projection,
   *   so echoing a fetched row back into a strict `replace` is `400`.
   *   For owner columns that is a feature — a spoof attempt is named
   *   instead of silently overwritten — but a read-modify-write client
   *   must strip server-owned keys first.
   * - **OpenAPI:** the schema gains `additionalProperties: false` only
   *   once the document passes through `nestjs-zod`'s
   *   `cleanupOpenApiDoc` (which lifts the per-property marker); a raw
   *   `SwaggerModule.createDocument` does not show it.
   * - On an `input` override, `input: z.object({...}).strict()` is the
   *   equivalent spelling; this flag exists for the DERIVED projection,
   *   which an app cannot otherwise reach.
   *
   * Opt-in per operation, not a resource default: stripping is the
   * long-standing generated-CRUD contract, and flipping it under
   * existing consumers would turn tolerated clients into broken ones.
   * Only valid on operations that HAVE a request body.
