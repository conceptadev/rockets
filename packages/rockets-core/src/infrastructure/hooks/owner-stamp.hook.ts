/**
 * Reusable repository hook that stamps the owner column from the current
 * actor on `Create` and `Update`. The actor is treated as the source of
 * truth: any client-supplied value for the owner column is silently
 * overwritten with `actor.id`, so spoofing another user is impossible.
 *
 * Use {@link OwnerStampHook.for}<E>() to bind the entity type and (if
 * needed) override the owner column.
 *
 * Pair with `OwnerScopeHook` to fully replace per-resource handler
 * overrides whose only responsibility was injecting `userId` from the
 * JWT.
 *
 * ## Behavior
 *
 * | Incoming `userId` field | Result                                    |
 * | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
 * | absent / empty          | stamped with `actor.id`                   |
 * | equals `actor.id`       | passes through unchanged                  |
 * | any other value         | overwritten with `actor.id`               |
 * | no actor in context     | `401 Unauthorized` (write requires actor) |
 *
 * ## Why this is not optional like `OwnerScopeHook`
 *
 * `OwnerScopeHook` no-ops on missing actor because public reads can
 * flow through. Writes can never legitimately reach the adapter without
 * an actor when this hook is wired — that means a route was incorrectly
 * marked `AuthPublic`, and we surface the misconfiguration instead of
 * silently writing rows with a missing/blank owner.
