/**
 * Generic guard that scopes a sub-resource by the parent's URL param.
 *
 * Auto-injected by `defineSubResource` (via `defineResource`) on EVERY
 * nested route, and it enforces two separable things:
 *
 * **Always — the addressed chain is real.**
 * 1. The parent entity exists (`404` otherwise).
 * 2. The parent is visible to the parent resource's own entity hooks —
 *    a parent hidden by a `beforeFindOne` / `afterFindOne` hook (soft
 *    expiry, tenant scope, retention) is a `404` here too. At three
 *    levels or more this is what verifies the ANCESTOR chain: the
 *    middle resource's own `PathScopeHook` is replayed on this lookup
 *    and rejects a middle row that does not belong to the addressed
 *    ancestor. Route params only ever filter by the IMMEDIATE parent, so
 *    without this a mismatched ancestor is served.
 *
 * **Only when `ownerColumn` is set — the actor owns the parent.**
 * 3. Authenticated actor (`401` otherwise).
 * 4. `ownerColumn === actor.id` (`404` — the same response as "missing"
 *    so a stranger cannot probe parent existence).
 *
 * `owner: false` / `scope: false` drop the OWNERSHIP half only. Dropping
 * the existence/chain half was never an opt-in: a request addressing a
 * row through a parent that does not contain it is malformed whoever
 * sends it.
 *
 * Sub-resources that need extra checks (e.g. body validation against a
 * lookup table) declare their own guard via `decorators: [UseGuards(X)]`.
 *
 * Bind via `PathScopeGuard.for(parentParam, parentEntityKey, ownerColumn)`.
 *
 * Why a Guard (not a Hook): Guards run before the CRUD pipeline so any
 * `HttpException` they throw propagates with the intended status. A
 * `Before*` repo hook that throws gets wrapped to a generic 500 by the
 * upstream membrane.
 *
 * Why the parent hooks are re-declared on a private context instead of
 * reusing the request's: `AppContextHost.defineOverlay` is first-write-
 * wins, and `HookContextOverlay` (an `APP_INTERCEPTOR`) has not run yet
 * when guards execute. Defining `HooksCtx` on the request here would
 * pin the PARENT's hooks onto the whole request and the sub-resource's
 * own hooks would never attach.
 *
 * What the replay context carries, and what it deliberately does not:
 *
 * - A CRUD context shaped like the parent's OWN read route —
 *   `entity: parentEntityKey`, `operation: Read`, and `params` = the
 *   request's route params with `id` bound to the parent being looked
 *   up. Without it `getCrudContext(ctx)` returns `undefined` and every
 *   hook that gates on a CRUD context — the shape this repo documents,
 *   an early return when the context is absent — silently no-ops here,
 *   including the framework's own `PathScopeHook`, which is what scopes
 *   a grandchild's parent lookup to ITS parent.
 * - The actor overlay, so owner-scoped parent hooks resolve "who".
 * - **No transaction.** Nest runs guards ahead of interceptors, so no
 *   operation transaction exists yet. The parent lookup is a pre-check,
 *   never a participant. See `CONFIGURATION.md` §5 and issue #60.
 * - **No `query`.** The guard applies no filters, sort or pagination of
 *   its own, so the parsed query is empty rather than the child route's.
