/**
 * In-process reference adapter for {@link RateLimitStoreInterface}
 * (issue #56) — in-memory, single-process, fixed-window. Correct for
 * tests, samples and single-instance deployments; a multi-instance one
 * needs a shared backend (a dynamic-repository table, Redis) behind the
 * same interface — two instances would each track their own count,
 * doubling the effective limit. See `CONFIGURATION.md` §7c.
 *
 * **Why this store evicts, and why that is not an optimisation.** The
 * counter key is derived from the request, and on the routes this store
 * exists to protect — public login, signup, recovery, OTP — part of that
 * key is attacker-supplied (the account field). Guards run BEFORE pipes
 * in Nest, so the value reaching the key function is unvalidated and
 * bounded only by the body-parser limit. A store that never frees an
 * entry therefore turns "requests that were correctly rate-limited" into
 * permanent memory: every rejected attempt still inserts a fresh key, and
 * a coarse per-IP ceiling does not help because each admitted request
 * carries a NEW account value. Unbounded growth inside the policy is the
 * failure mode, not growth from exceeding it.
 *
 * Two bounds, both cheap:
 *
 * - **Least-recently-used order.** Every `consume` re-inserts its key at
 *   the back of the map, so iteration order IS recency order and the
 *   front is the least recently used key. Ordering by expiry instead put
 *   the coarse ceiling key — created on request one of a flood and only
 *   updated since — at the head of the eviction queue: the
 *   account-rotation traffic the ceiling exists to stop was what evicted
 *   the ceiling. A hot key is touched every request, so LRU keeps it.
 * - **A hard key cap.** Eviction drops from the front until the map is
 *   back at `maxKeys` — one entry per request at the cap, never a scan
 *   or a sort of the whole map. Under the flood this bound exists for
 *   that difference is the difference between O(1) and O(n log n) on
 *   every request, on the event loop the app answers requests with.
 *
 * Dropping a LIVE window resets its counter, which raises the effective
 * limit for that key, so it is reported — rate-limited to one message a
 * minute, because at the cap it happens on every request and a per-request
 * `warn` is its own outage.
 *
 * A caller that must never lose a count under abuse wants a shared,
 * persistent store; that is what the port exists for.
