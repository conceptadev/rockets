 * Transport-agnostic identity of "who is performing the current operation".

 * should consume. It deliberately omits HTTP-specific concerns (claims,
 * roles, raw JWT payload) so the same hook compiles in non-HTTP contexts
 * (background jobs, CLI commands, test harnesses) where there is no
 * `request.user` to read.
 *
 * For role / claim checks, consumers read the v8 `AuthUserCtx` overlay
 * (or use the `@AuthUser()` decorator). For "who did this", everything
 * else uses `Actor`.
 *
 * `metadata` is a free-form bag for callers that need to carry extra data
 * with the actor (tenant id, impersonation chain, source channel) without
 * forcing a new field into every call site.
