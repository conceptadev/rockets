# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 - 2026-09-16

### Added

- **`toNodeReadable(object)`** on the root and `/core` entry points.
  `StorageObject.body` is a web `ReadableStream`, but TypeScript resolves
  that bare name against the CONSUMER's `lib`: a project with `"DOM"` binds
  it to the DOM declaration, and `Readable.fromWeb()` is typed against
  `node:stream/web`, so piping a downloaded object into an HTTP response
  failed to compile. Every Node server hits this on its first streamed
  download, and the package already carried five internal casts for the
  same mismatch. The conversion now lives in one documented place instead
  of in each consumer.

- Initial `@concepta/rockets-storage` preview with a provider-neutral storage
  client and driver contract, named NestJS stores, streaming operations,
  normalized errors, conditional mutations, signed transfers, cross-store
  workflows, and Files SDK adapters for filesystem, runtime-selected, and
  S3-compatible providers.

### Fixed

- **Driver subpaths were unreachable on legacy TypeScript resolution.**
  `typesVersions` mapped only `core` and `files-sdk`, so a project on
  `moduleResolution: "Node"` — which `examples/sample-server` and Nest's own
  scaffolding use — could type a `StorageDriver` but never import one:
  `@concepta/rockets-storage/files-sdk/fs` failed with TS2307. Every subpath
  is mapped now. The remaining caveat is upstream's: the driver `.d.ts`
  re-export types from `files-sdk`, which ships an export map and no
  `typesVersions`, so a Node10 project needs `skipLibCheck: true` (the
  default in Nest's scaffolding) to avoid type-checking into it. The
  packed-consumer gate pins both cases with separate fixtures.
