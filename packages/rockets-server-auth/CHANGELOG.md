# Changelog

All notable changes to the `@concepta/rockets-auth` package will be
documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Complete public account-recovery HTTP flow: enumeration-safe initiation,
  passcode validation, and OTP-authorized password rotation.
- Default global throttling with stricter login and recovery limits; hosts can
  configure it or explicitly opt out.
- End-to-end readiness coverage for duplicate CQRS ownership, recovery,
  password reuse policy, and login throttling.

### Changed

- `defineRocketsAuth()` now returns a complete composition: auth persistence
  rows, root repository, user-metadata contract, and guard preference travel
  with the integration. Its Rockets guard defaults off because the built-in
  authentication module already owns a JWT global guard; mixed-auth hosts can
  explicitly reverse that ownership.
- CQRS handlers have one owner. Signup and password-validation registrations no
  longer compete with upstream handlers for the same command.
- Admin role handler overrides now apply consistently to list, read, create,
  update, and delete operations.
- Generated controller factories share one typed decorator path, and the
  controller extras contract no longer advertises the unsupported `useHooks`
  option or an unused handler-override alias.
- Recovery password rotation preserves history, strength validation,
  transactions, and credential lifecycle events.
- Node.js 20 is the minimum supported runtime.

### Removed

- The nonfunctional `rockets-auth-swagger` manifest entry. Applications
  generate OpenAPI from their own complete Nest entry module.

## [1.0.0-alpha.7] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- **NestJS 11 upgrade**: Bumped all `@nestjs/*` dependencies to v11
  (`@nestjs/common`, `@nestjs/core`, `@nestjs/swagger`, `@nestjs/jwt`,
  `@nestjs/passport`, `@nestjs/config`, `@nestjs/throttler`, `@nestjs/testing`,
  `@nestjs/typeorm`, `@nestjs/platform-express`) and updated `@concepta/*`
  packages from `7.0.0-alpha.8` to `7.0.0-alpha.10`.
- **Invitation acceptance module**: Simplified and consolidated module
  definition; reduced boilerplate in `invitation-acceptance-data.interface` and
  acceptance controller.
- **Admin module**: Refactored `RocketsAuthAdminModule` for consistency; added
  CRUD relations support for roles in `RocketsAuthRoleAdminModule`.
- **Options interfaces**: Trimmed verbose JSDoc in
  `rockets-auth-options-extras.interface` and `rockets-auth-options.interface`
  to concise descriptions.
- **Module definition**: Simplified `rockets-auth.module-definition`
  configuration and provider setup.
- **Fixture imports**: Replaced deep `dist/` imports with root package imports
  for `auth-jwt`, `auth-refresh`, and `authentication` service fixtures.
- **Swagger generation**: Added `stripTopLevelResponseSchemas` cleanup pass, set
  contact and license metadata, and updated generated `swagger.json`.

### Added

- **Compatibility shim**: New `shared/compat/concepta-internals.ts` centralizes
  all deep `@concepta/*/dist` imports to minimize churn when upstream packages
  update exports.
- **Admin relations e2e tests**: New `rockets-auth-admin.relations.e2e-spec.ts`
  covering user-role CRUD relation endpoints.

## [1.0.0-alpha.5] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- **Password change endpoint**: New authenticated endpoint for users to change
  their password (`me-password` controller and DTO).
- **Invitation system**: CRUD relations and comprehensive documentation for the
  invitation flow.

### Changed

- **Role update DTO and interface**: `RocketsAuthRoleUpdatableInterface` and
  role update DTO now treat `id` as optional (partial). This supports
  PATCH-style APIs where the role id is provided in the URL (e.g.
  `PATCH /roles/:id`) and the body only contains fields to update. Apps that
  require `id` in the body can still declare `id!: string` on their extended
  DTO.
- **User metadata model service**: Aligned `RocketsAuthUserMetadataModelService`
  with shared user-metadata model service interface and SDK patterns.
- **User DTOs and interfaces**: User create/update/metadata DTOs and interfaces
  updated; user metadata module definition and signup module adjustments.
- **Invitation**: Acceptance, reattempt, and revocation controllers and DTOs;
  invitation acceptance module and OTP settings.
- **Fixtures and tests**: Updated role and user DTO fixtures; admin and signup
  module specs; e2e and notification/OTP service tests.
- **Renaming and configuration**: Module and option renames; shared config and
  constants updates.

## [1.0.0-alpha.4] - 2026-01-23

### Changed

- **User response DTO**: Updated user response DTO for consistency with API
  responses and user metadata.

## [1.0.0-alpha.3] - 2026-01-22

### Changed

- **Type handling**: Add type string to array for DTOs and validation.

## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2025-12-03

### Added

- **Invitation feature**: Full invitation flow with CRUD, acceptance
  validations, and security improvements.

### Changed

- **Invitation acceptance**: Improved validation and security on invitation
  flow.
- **User metadata**: Updates to user metadata handling and DTOs.
- **Packages**: Removed prepublish from packages; version and yarn updates.
- **Tests and tooling**: Test fixes, Codacy and lint updates.

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2025-10-28

  publishing.
