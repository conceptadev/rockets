/**
 * Regression test pair for G9 (`.context/upstream-gaps.md`).
 *
 * The two tests are intentionally adjacent so the bug + workaround are
 * self-documenting: anyone removing `RocketsValidateCurrentPasswordHandler`
 * (or `RocketsValidateCurrentPasswordOverrideModule`) immediately sees the
 * upstream behavior they would re-expose.
 *
 * - **Test 1 (bug demonstration):** the upstream `PasswordCreationService.validateCurrent`
 *   does `{ password, ...target }`. When `target` is a v8 aggregate that exposes
 *   `passwordHash` via a getter on the prototype (not as an own enumerable
 *   property), the spread silently drops the field. bcrypt then compares
 *   the supplied password against `undefined` and returns `false` for a
 *   valid password.
 *
 * - **Test 2 (workaround in action):** our `RocketsValidateCurrentPasswordHandler`
 *   normalizes the target via `toPlain()` / `.props` / direct property read
 *   into a plain `PasswordStorageInterface` before delegating to the same
 *   upstream service. Same input, correct result.
 *
 * When upstream ships the spread fix:
 *   1. Test 1 will flip to returning `true` (delete it; the assertion
 *      becomes meaningless and would silently hide future regressions).
 *   2. Test 2 stays useful as a structural-contract test until the override
 *      module is removed.
