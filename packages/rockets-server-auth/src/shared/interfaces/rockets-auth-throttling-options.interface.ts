/**
 * Request-throttling configuration for Rockets Auth's own public routes,
 * built on core's rate-limit port (`@RateLimit` + `RateLimitGuard` +
 * `RateLimitStoreInterface`).
 *
 * Two dimensions, both enforced at once on every guarded auth route:
 *
 * - `ip` — a coarse per-IP volume ceiling. It is not overridden per
 *   route, so rotating the account field from one source cannot escape
 *   it (credential stuffing, signup/recovery spam).
 * - `default` — fine per-`(ip, account)` limits. Keying on the pair
 *   means an attacker only throttles themselves, never locks a victim
 *   out of login. Routes tighten this one with `@RateLimit`.
 *
 * `store` swaps the backing counter store. The default is core's
 * `InMemoryRateLimitStore` — per process, which is also what the
 * previous engine shipped. A multi-instance deployment wants a shared
 * backend behind the same `RateLimitStoreInterface`
 * (`CONFIGURATION.md` §7c shows a dynamic-repository one).
